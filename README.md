# dept-store-database

CMPT258 Fall 2018

The database for this project was created to be used by the managers and regular employees of a department store. There are seven menus available. Managers can add an employee paycheck, modify department information, terminate an employee, or view a sale history of an employee. Managers can only perform actions on the employees of their department. Employees can process transactions and view the sale history of a particular product. The last menu exits the program. In order to access manager menu options, a manager ID number is required. This is then verified by entering the social security number of the manager who matches the entered ID number. For employee menus, only the employeeâ€™s ID number needs to be entered.
